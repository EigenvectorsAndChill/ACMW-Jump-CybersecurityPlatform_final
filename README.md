# üîê **Advanced AI-Powered Security Monitoring System**

This project is an advanced **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system that integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** to simulate and detect security threats in real time.

---

## üöÄ **Overview**

The system provides intelligent security monitoring by:

- Using **LLMs** to **generate realistic synthetic security logs** and events that mimic real-world threats.
- Ingesting logs into the **ELK Stack** for centralized log management and analysis.
- Enabling dynamic, **AI-assisted detection** of anomalies, threat patterns, and suspicious activities.
- Offering **real-time dashboards** and visualizations for security analysts.

This setup mimics the complexity of modern enterprise environments and is ideal for research, education, red teaming, or testing threat detection pipelines.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Roles and Responsibilities**

### 1) **Security & Database Engineer**  
**Assigned to: Shreyaa**  
- **Focus**: Traditional security analysis and database handling.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Create rule-based detection systems using security patterns.  
  - Work with multiple data sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
  - Examples:  
    - Alert when 5+ failed logins occur in 1 minute.  
    - Detect suspicious access at odd hours.  
    - Identify multiple logins from different locations.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, SQL, security tools.  
- **Why it's great**: Perfect for building foundational security skills with guided support.

### 2) **Data Infrastructure Engineer**  
**Assigned to: Sivangi**  
- **Focus**: Building the monitoring system and data pipelines.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Set up the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for real-time monitoring.  
  - Create data pipelines for processing security logs.  
  - Design dashboards for real-time attack monitoring.  
  - Examples:  
    - Handle 1000+ events/second in real-time log processing.  
    - Create live dashboards for monitoring attacks.  
- **Tech Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, APIs.  
- **Why it's great**: A step-by-step guide will be provided for ELK setup and configuration.  

---

### 3) **ML Engineer** 
**Assigned to: Darshitha**  
- **Focus**: Developing machine learning models for threat detection.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Build anomaly detection systems.  
  - Identify unusual patterns (e.g., sudden data downloads, malware behavior).  
  - Examples:  
    - Detect unusual patterns in user behavior.  
    - Identify potential malware activity.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, ML libraries, security integration.  
- **Why it's great**: This is the most challenging role, but you'll receive extra guidance and regular code reviews.  

---

### 4) **LLM Engineer** 
**Assigned to: Sandra**  
- **Focus**: Generating realistic security data using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Create diverse security scenarios for testing and training.  
  - Examples:  
    - Generate fake but realistic attack patterns.  
    - Simulate normal vs. suspicious behavior.  
- **Tech Stack**: LLM APIs, Python, data generation.  
- **Why it's great**: A complex but exciting role with guidance on LLM integration and API usage.
