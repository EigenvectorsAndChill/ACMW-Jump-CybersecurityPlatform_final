# 🔐 Advanced AI-Powered Security Monitoring System

This project is an advanced **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution that integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** to simulate and detect security threats in real time.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The system provides intelligent security monitoring by:

- Using **LLMs** to **generate realistic synthetic security logs** and events that mimic real-world threats.
- Ingesting logs into the **ELK Stack** for centralized log management and analysis.
- Enabling dynamic, **AI-assisted detection** of anomalies, threat patterns, and suspicious activities.
- Offering **real-time dashboards** and visualizations for security analysts.

This setup mimics the complexity of modern enterprise environments and is ideal for research, education, red teaming, or testing threat detection pipelines.
